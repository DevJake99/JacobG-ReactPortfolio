## Description
This Project is a react portolio that showcases my projects and skills used throughout the course of my Bootcamp. This portfolio uses a react front end, with different css technologies like Sassy CSS (SCSS) and animation.css to achieve state of the art animations and organization techniques within the CSS files. Feel free to contact me using the form located on the 'Contact' page and check out the projects via the attatched links to explore more of my work. 
    
    
## Credits/Contributors
With the help of free code camp, Pedro tech, and UCI FSF Bootcamp, I was able to learn a lot from their tutorials and courses which helped and inspired me to create the work that I am so proud of now.
